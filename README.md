# Distribution Selection

We've covered some important distributions thus far: binomial, uniform, poisson, geometric, exponential, and of course, the normal distribution! Now it's time to put those all together and practice selecting the appropriate distribution for various scenarios.  

Here's a brief recap:  

**Binomial Distribution**  
Given the probability of success (such as flipping a coin; Heads vs Tails) what is the probability of 2 successes on 5 trials?  

**Uniform Distribution**  
Everything has equal probability of occuring.  

**Poisson Distribution**  
Calculates the probability of a discrete number of events occurring in a continuous space or period.

**Geometric Distribution**  
Models the number of trials before the first success.  

**Exponential Distribution**  
The continuous analogue of the geometric distribution - it describes the time between the occurrence of events.  

**Normal Distribution**  
The classic [symmetrical] bell shaped curve. Also known as the Gaussian distribution. Often the assumed distribution for unknown variables (including error).

# Car Sales
A car sales person sells an average of 2 cars per week. What's the probability that he/she sells 4 in a given week?


```python
#Your code here
```

# Car Sales 2
What's the probability that the car salesperson sells 0 cars in a given week?


```python
#Your code here
```

# Car Sales 3
Whats' the probability that the car salesperson sells 0 cars in 2 consecutive weeks?


```python
#Your code here
```

# Car Sales 4!
The sales associate is worried about not getting paid for a period of time. What's the probability that 2 weeks (or more) pass between selling one car and the next?

# SAT Scores
Below is a sample of SAT scores (yes SAT scores are now out of 2400 not 1600):
Assuming the sample is representative, what would be the estimated percentile rank be of someone who scored a 2000?


```python
import numpy as np
```


```python
 scores = [1710, 1460,2060,1010,1690,1080,1940,1050,1020,1280,
 1240,1570,1690,910,1570,1440,1530,1700,1750,1320,
 2050,1430,1340,960,1480,890,1620,1280,1750, 1490]
```

# Coin Flips
Assuming that you're using a fair coin, what's the probability of flipping 8 heads on 10 flips?


```python
#Your code here
```

# Coin Flips 2
What's the probability that you have to flip a coin 5 times in order to get the first head?


```python
#Your code here
```

# Trains
Assuming the train system is on a perfect schedule where trains show up exactly every 10 minutes (ignoring reality).
What is the probability that a rider who randomly shows up has to wait at least 3 minutes for a train?


```python
#Your code here
```
